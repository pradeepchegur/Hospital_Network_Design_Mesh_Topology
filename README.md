# Hospital_Network_Design_Mesh_Topology
Implemented Mesh topology for Hospital Network Design using Cisco packet tracer which involves VLAN,DHCP, DNS, Subnetting, HTTP,SMTP, WIFI and more.

## Abstract
This report describes the network design of Hospital Network. In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches, routers or other devices) are connected to a virtual local area network (VLAN). We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network mesh topology.


## Hospital segments:
OPD with 3 floors

Ward Hub with 3 floors

ICU with 3 floors

Admin with 3 floors

IT Hub with 3 floors

## Features and Services:
• DHCP

• DNS

• Subnetting

• HTTPS

• AAA

• SMTP

• VLAN

• WIFI

• DCE Cables

• OSPF Routing Protocol

## Proposed methodology:
• 5 routers are connected to each other by Mesh topology.

• Each floor has one switch.

• Each floor has Wi-fi networks connected to laptops and phones.

• Each floor is in different VLAN.

• Using OSPF as routing protocol to advertise routers.

• All the devices in network communicate with each other.

• Configuring HTTP, SMTP and AAA services.

• All devices obtain IP dynamically with their router configured as DHCP server.

• All routers connected to each other using serial DCE cable.
